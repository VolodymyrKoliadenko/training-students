This volcanism manifests itself with about 10 silicic caldera complexes of the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex and more than 50 recently active volcanoes; Lascar in 1993 erupted and produced a tall eruption column.17  Andesitic stratovolcanoes reaching elevations of about 5,000 metres (16,000 ft) are found at El Tatio east of the field,17 while the Sierra de Tucle lies to the southwest of it.18 From north to south the andesitic stratovolcanoes include the 5,651-metre (18,540 ft) high Cerro Deslinde, the 5,560-metre (18,240 ft) high Cerro El Volcan, the 5,280–5,570-metre (17,320–18,270 ft) high Cordillera del Tatio and the 5,314-metre (17,434 ft) high Volcan Tatio, and they collectively form the El Tatio volcanic group.19720  The geothermal field of El Tatio lies in a graben between the stratovolcanoes in the east and the Serrania de Tucle-Loma Lucero horst in the west.1720 Mountains southwest of El Tatio include the 4,570–4,690-metre (14,990–15,390 ft) Alto Ojo del Cablor, while 4,812-metre (15,787 ft) high Cerro Copacoya is situated northwest of the geothermal field.21 Dacitic volcanism, older than the easterly stratovolcanoes, has occurred west of El Tatio;7 this volcanism was known as the \"liparitic formation\" and it covers large areas in the region.b23  Firn and snow fields were reported in the middle 20th century on the El Tatio volcanic group, at elevations of 4,900–5,200 metres (16,100–17,100 ft).24 The region is too dry to support glaciers today,25 but in the past higher moisture allowed their formation on mountains of this part of the Andes;2627 glacially eroded mountains and moraines testify to their existence.28 A large moraine complex, including both terminal structures and well-developed lateral moraines, can be found north of the geyser field.29 Two more moraine systems extend westward both northeast and southeast of El Tatio, and the terrain surrounding the geyser field is covered by sands that are interpreted as glacial outwash sands.30  Drainage in the area is generally from east to west down the Western Cordillera,31 often in form of steeply incised valleys.14 The Rio Salado drains most of the hot spring water3132 and has its headwaters in the field9 where it is joined by the Rio Tucle.3132 Temperature measurements of the water flowing to the Rio Salado have yielded values of 17–32 °C (63–90 °F),24 while the discharge of the Rio Salado amounts to 0.25–0.5 cubic metres per second (8.8–17.7 cu ft/s).33 The Rio Salado eventually joins the Rio Loa, a major source of freshwater for the region;9 thus, El Tatio plays an important role in the regional water supply.34 Geothermal field  El Tatio is well known as a geothermal field in Chile,10 and is the largest geyser field in the southern hemisphere with about 8% of all geysers in the world and is (together with Sol de Mañana) the highest geyser field in the world.3512 Only Yellowstone in the United States and Dolina Geizerov in Russia are larger35 and their geysers are taller than these at El Tatio.36 The Andes rise behind El Tatio  The geothermal field covers an area of 30 square kilometres (12 sq mi) at elevations of 4,200–4,600 metres (13,800–15,100 ft), and is characterized by fumaroles, hot springs, steam vents known as soffioni and steaming soil. Stronger geothermal activity is located within three discrete areas covering a total of 10 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi) surface, and includes boiling water fountains, hot springs, geysers, mudpots, mud volcanoes and sinter terraces;3712 further, chimneys of extinct geysers have been noted.38 One of these three areas lies within a valley, the second on a flat surface and the third along the banks of the Rio Salado.4 The first area offers a notable contrast between the snow-covered Andes, the coloured hills that surround the field and the white deposits left by the geothermal activity. Most geysers of El Tatio are found here and are particularly noticeable in cold weather. A similar landscape exists at the third (lower) area, with the presence of the Rio Salado river adding an additional element to the landscape.3940 The second area is located between a creek and a hill and includes an artificial 15-by-30-metre (49 ft × 98 ft) pool for tourists.41  The field once numbered 67 geysers and more than three hundred hot springs. Many vents are linked to fractures that run northwest-southeast or southwest-northeast across the field.20 Some geyser fountains reached heights greater than 10 metres (33 ft);42 usually, however, they do not exceed 1 metre (3 ft 3 in).35 A few geysers have received names, such as Boiling Geyser, El Cobreloa, El Cobresal, El Jefe, Terrace Geyser, Tower Geyser and Vega Rinconada.434445 An additional geothermal system lies southeast of and at elevations above El Tatio and is characterized by steam-heated ponds fed by precipitation water,9 and solfataric activity has been reported on the stratovolcanoes farther east.23 The sinter landscape formed at El Tatio  Deposition of sinter from the waters of the geothermal field has given rise to spectacular landforms, including, but not limited to mounds, terraced pools, geyser cones and the dams that form their rims.2037 Small scale features include cones, crusts, mollusc-shaped formations and waterfall-like surfaces.46 High contents of silica give the waters a blueish colour, organic compounds such as carotenoids conversely often colour the sinter with orange-brown,47 and greenish hues are owing to iron-oxidizing bacteria.48      Hot springs form pools with water temperatures of 60–80 °C (140–176 °F), which are often gently moving and surging and in the case of the warmer springs actively bubbling. These pools often contain ball-like rocks called oncoids and are surrounded by sinter rims, which have spicule-like textures.49 These sinter rims often form dam-like structures around deeper vents which are filled with water.50 Spherical grains develop in the hot springs as a consequence of hydrodynamic processes, and include biogenic material; during the growth of the sinter they often end up embedded in the material.51     Flowing water that drains from the springs deposits sinter, which can form fairly thick deposits and large aprons when sheet flow occurs, known as \"discharge deposits\"; sometimes terraces are developed instead. As in springs, oncoids and spicules are observed in channels. Much of the water evaporates and its temperature drops from 30–35 °C (86–95 °F) to less than 20 °C (68 °F) away from the springs;52 the low air temperatures cause it to freeze occasionally, resulting in frost weathering.53     Geysers and also water fountains discharge from up to 3-metre (9.8 ft) high cones5450 with gently sloping surfaces, which sometimes support splash mounds55 and are constructed by geyserite.56 Other geysers and fountains instead discharge from within rim-bounded pools,54 and some geysers are located on the bed of the Rio Salado river.4 The activity of geysers is not stable over time, changes in water supply or in the properties of the conduit that supplies them can cause changes in their eruptive activity. Such changes can be triggered by rainfall events or earthquakes and at El Tatio geyser behaviour changes have been linked to the 2014 Iquique earthquake and a 2013 precipitation event.57 The water of geysers is 80–85 °C (176–185 °F) warm.55     Mud pools are often bubbling, with the hot mud fountaining.24 Simmering pools of water have been recorded at El Tatio as well.";
